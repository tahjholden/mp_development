## Log

### 2024-05-XX

- **Error:** `Property 'groupId' does not exist on type 'PgTableWithColumns<...>'`
  - **Root Cause:** Code was accessing group/team info directly on `mpCorePerson` instead of joining with `mpCorePersonGroup` and `mpCoreGroup` after schema normalization.
  - **Fix:** Refactored all queries to use proper joins and select group/team info from the correct tables.

- **Error:** `Module '"@/lib/db/schema"' has no exported member 'mpbc_observations'. Did you mean 'mpbcObservations'?`
  - **Root Cause:** Importing tables using snake_case instead of camelCase (Drizzle convention).
  - **Fix:** Updated all imports and usages to use camelCase table names.

- **Error:** `Type '(player: SharedPlayer) => void' is not assignable to type '(player: Player) => void'.`
  - **Root Cause:** Multiple incompatible `Player` interfaces/types across components.
  - **Fix:** Standardized all components to use the `Player` type from `PlayerListCard` and updated all usages.

- **Error:** `Type '{ [k: string]: { id: string; name: string; team: string; status: string; }; }' is not assignable to type 'Record<string, Player>'.`
  - **Root Cause:** Local Player type did not match the canonical Player type used in shared components.
  - **Fix:** Updated local types and state to use the shared Player type.
